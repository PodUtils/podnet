#
# TARGET is x86_64-unknown-linux-musl or aarch64-unknown-linux-musl (the
# targets that release.yml builds in the pinned image of images/build), by
# default the one of this machine. The script needs git, curl, sha256sum
# and docker (or podman: CONTAINER=podman).
#
# The source is the tag, in a new directory at a path that is not the one
# of release.yml (/work), and the build runs in the image of
# images/build/Dockerfile of the tag, pinned to a digest, with the same
# command and variables as release.yml. The binary must have the SHA-256
# of SHA256SUMS. Exit 0 when it matches, 1 when it does not.
