//! Name resolution for each direct dial of podnet ([`crate::egress`]): the
//! resolver of `pod-dns` (PodUtils/podcrates) with podnet's settings
//! ([`settings`]).
//!
//! The chain, in order:
//!
//! 1. An IP address is used as it is.
//! 2. A pin of `--resolve HOST=IP` or `PODNET_RESOLVE` (a comma-separated list
//!    of `HOST=IP`). TLS still checks the name of the certificate.
//! 3. The system resolver (`/etc/resolv.conf`), with a time limit of
//!    [`STEP_TIMEOUT`].
//! 4. DNS over HTTPS by IP address, at the operators of the services of the
//!    kind `doh` of `pod-services` that serve the JSON form: Cloudflare, then
//!    Google, IPv4 and IPv6. On a host with no IPv4 default route, the IPv6
//!    servers go first. TLS checks the IP address in the certificate. An
//!    answer that the name does not exist (NXDOMAIN) skips the other servers
//!    of that operator; the next operator is asked (issue 119). Through a
//!    proxy that resolves names, the servers by name come after them.
//!
//! A dial through a proxy gives the name to the proxy and resolves nothing
//! here. The host of the proxy itself, and each name that a DoH query
//! resolves, use steps 1 to 3 only ([`plain`]): a DoH query can go through
//! the proxy (issue 259).
