# Security

## Report a vulnerability

Do not open a public issue for a vulnerability. Use the private report of
GitHub: open <https://github.com/PodUtils/podnet/security/advisories/new>
and write these items:

* the version (`podnet --version`) and the system (`podnet status`);
* the steps that show the fault;
* what an attacker can do, and what the attacker must have first.

The maintainer replies in the report. A fix comes in a new release, and the
report becomes a public advisory after the release.

## Supported versions

Only the latest release and `main` get fixes. A prerelease (a tag with a
suffix, for example `v0.3.0-beta.1`) is replaced by the next release.

## Dependencies

* `.github/workflows/deny.yml` runs `cargo deny` on each push and each day:
  advisories, licenses, bans and sources (`deny.toml`).
* An advisory stops CI. Update the crate, or replace it. If no fixed version
  exists and podnet does not use the affected part, add the advisory to
  `[advisories] ignore` in `deny.toml` with the reason and the date it was
  read.
* Dependabot opens the updates of crates, actions and images each week.

The release files have checksums, provenance and a signature. See "Release
binaries" in `docs/install.md`.

## What Cloudflare can see

* TLS between the visitor and the tunnel ends at the Cloudflare edge. The
  edge sees each request and each response of the origin in clear text.
* The hostname of a quick tunnel (`*.trycloudflare.com`) is public. Anyone
  who has the URL can send requests to the origin. A quick tunnel has no
  access control. `podnet share` adds a PIN with `--password` (and always in
  proxy mode). `podnet serve` and `podnet tunnel` add nothing.
* `podnet serve` and `podnet share` publish files to the internet. Serve only
  the files that you want to give to all users.
* The WARP service sees the destination, the time and the volume of each
  connection that goes through WARP, and the content of each connection that
  has no TLS of its own.
* The edge, the quick-tunnel service and the WARP API see the public IP
  address of the host.
* When the system resolver gives no address, podnet asks DNS over HTTPS at
  Cloudflare (1.1.1.1, 1.0.0.1) and Google (8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4). These servers
  see the names that podnet resolves. A pin (`--resolve`) or a proxy sends no
  name to them.

## What the relay can see

The WebSocket-to-TCP relay of `--transport relay` and of the reverse mode
(`podnet relay`) is a service of the owner of podnet
(`tcp.ssh.relay.ajam.dev` and the hosts of its pool). Another relay is set
with `--relay` or `PODNET_RELAY`.

* `--transport relay`: the relay opens TCP to the edge. It sees the edge
  address and port, the public IP address of the host, the time and the
  volume. It does not see the tunnel: the TLS to the edge (with the edge
  roots of podnet) is inside the WebSocket.
* The reverse mode (`relay node`, `relay connect`): the relay carries the
  bytes of each session as they are. There is no encryption from end to
  end in podnet. Use a protocol with its own encryption through it (SSH,
  TLS).
* A minted token goes only to the hosts of its deployment: the hosts
  under the parent domain of the first host (`pod-relay` of
  PodUtils/podcrates, its `token::token_key`). Each deployment of a list
  gets its own token. A fixed token (`PODNET_RELAY_TOKEN`) goes to each
  host of the list.
* The relay can end a session at any time. It ends each session at 64 MiB
  or after 12 h. podnet replaces an edge connection before that (60 MiB,
  11 h 30 min).

## What listens

podnet listens only when a command asks for it. A tunnel connects out to the
edge; it does not listen. The commands below listen:

| Command | Default address | Who can connect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `podnet warp proxy` | `tcp://127.0.0.1:40000` | Each user of the host (loopback TCP). Use `--listen unix:/path` for the owner only. |
| `podnet net proxy` | `unix:/tmp/podnet-vnet.socks` | The owner only (socket mode 0600). |
| `podnet net switch` | `unix:/tmp/podnet-vnet.switch` | The owner only (socket mode 0600, and the user of the peer, `SO_PEERCRED`). A TCP listener takes each peer that sends the shared token (`PODNET_SWITCH_TOKEN` or `--switch-token-file`); with no token it does not start. The token is not encrypted. The switch drops a packet whose source address is of another peer. |
| `podnet net proxy --control NAME`, `--import VIRT`, the shim | abstract names `\0NAME`, `\0podnet-vnet/...` | The same user only (`SO_PASSCRED`, `SO_PEERCRED`). An abstract name has no file permissions. |
| `podnet net tailscale` | `unix:/tmp/podnet-socks.sock` | The owner only (socket mode 0600). |
| `podnet connect -L` | no default | `tcp://port` binds `127.0.0.1`. A Unix socket has mode 0600. |
| `podnet pod --serve` | no default | A Unix socket has mode 0600. A TCP address is open to each user who can reach it. |
| `podnet pod`, `podnet warp run` (seccomp backend) | `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/podnet-netns-inbound/<port>.sock`, else `$TMPDIR/podnet-netns-inbound-<uid>/<port>.sock` | The owner only (socket mode 0600, directory of the user, mode 0700). One socket for each port that the program listens on. podnet refuses a directory of another user, and a directory that the group or others can write. |

A TCP address that is not a loopback address is open to the network. podnet
does not refuse it, because some hosts permit no other listener.

`tests/cli/manual.rs` (`the_listen_defaults_agree_with_the_manual`) checks the
defaults in this table against `podnet man --json`.

## Secrets

| Secret | Where podnet keeps it |
| --- | --- |
| Named-tunnel token and secret | In memory only. Give it in `TUNNEL_TOKEN`, a file (`--token-file`, `TUNNEL_TOKEN_FILE`), a config file or a cloudflared credentials file. `--token` also works, but other users of the host can read a command line. |
| WARP device token, MASQUE private key, WARP+ license | The identity file (`podnet man files`), mode 0600, in a directory with mode 0700. podnet writes it to a new file and then renames it. podnet refuses an identity file that belongs to another user, or that the group or other users can read. |
| Proxy user and password | In the proxy variables or `-x`. |
| Relay token | `PODNET_RELAY_TOKEN`, or a minted token in `relay-token-HOST.json` (mode 0600) in the state directory, in the form of `pod-relay`. podnet does not use a cache file that is a link, of another user, readable by others or over 64 KiB. |
| Relay pair (node, connect and stop tokens) | `relay/pair-NAME.json` in the state directory, mode 0600, in a directory of mode 0700. |

These rules apply to each secret:

* No log line, error line or failure report holds it. The `Debug` text of
  `Credentials`, the WARP `Device` and `Account`, and `Proxy` shows
  `<hidden>`. Each error line and each line of the failure report goes
  through `report::mask`, which hides the user and the password of each URL,
  the value of each proxy variable that has a user part, and the token.
* `tests/cli/log.rs` (`the_log_holds_no_secret`) runs podnet with `RUST_LOG=trace`
  and a token, a WARP identity and a proxy password. The test fails when one
  of them is in the output.

## TLS

Each TLS connection that podnet opens as a client checks the certificate and
the host name. `crates/podnet-core/src/trust.rs` gives the roots:

1. The file of `--ca-file`, else the file of `SSL_CERT_FILE`. podnet uses this
   file alone.
2. Else `podnet-ca.pem` beside the binary, the first system bundle that podnet
   can read, and the Mozilla roots compiled into podnet (webpki-roots, version
   in `trust::ROOTS_CRATE_VERSION`; a test compares it with `Cargo.lock`).

The edge also trusts the Cloudflare roots of the fact `roots` of the edge of
`pod-services` (PodUtils/podcrates), the certificates of
`src/cloudflare/cf-edge-roots.pem`. The first of them ends on 2029-08-15
(`trust::edge_roots_first_end`; a test of `pod-services` reads it from the
certificates). The MASQUE connection of WARP checks the
key of the server against the key that the WARP API gave, and does not
connect without one.

Only an origin can turn off the check: `noTLSVerify` in a config file, or
`--no-tls-verify`. A test (`trust::tests::no_other_code_sets_its_own_verifier`)
fails when other code sets its own certificate verifier.

When a certificate is expired or its validity starts later, the error
line also gives the clock of the host: a wrong clock is a frequent cause
in a container.

## Text from the network

Text from a peer (an edge error, an HTTP body, a proxy reply) can hold
control characters that a terminal acts on. `report::clean` removes each
escape sequence, BEL, CR, and the other control characters except tab and
line feed. Each error line and the failure report go through it. The log
writer (`tracing-subscriber`) escapes control characters in the log fields.
A test (`report::tests::the_error_line_has_no_control_characters`) sends
ESC, BEL, CR and C1 controls through the error path.

## Known gaps

* No third party has audited podnet.
* The Cap'n Proto encoding, the RPC subset, the HTTP/2 edge transport, the
  MASQUE client and the YAML reader are written for podnet. Each parser of
  bytes from the network has a libFuzzer target in `fuzz/`
  (`.github/workflows/fuzz.yml`), but fuzzing finds only some defects.
* podnet is for Linux only. It does not read the certificate stores of
  Windows or macOS, and no release is built for them.
* The `/tmp` paths of the Unix sockets are known to each user. Another user
  can make the path first. Then the bind fails; podnet does not use the file of
  the other user. Use `--listen unix:` with a path in a private directory.
