# Issues

Each GitHub issue of the record, with its entries. The State starts with the
state on GitHub: `open`, `closed` or `deleted`. `TODO/github.txt` lists the
numbers: each number from #311 on, and each open number before #311. The
record does not hold the closed issues before #311; their text is on GitHub
or in `docs/reports/`. `TODO/RULES.md` gives the rules.
